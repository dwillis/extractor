## Extractor

Extractor is a Python app that, given a URL, presents the text extracted from it, using the [eatiht library](https://github.com/rodricios/eatiht) (Thanks to [Rodrigo Palacios](https://github.com/rodricios) for his excellent library.) You can see it in action [on Heroku](http://extractor.herokuapp.com/).

Extractor has an HTTP interface and an API (see [sample](http://extractor.herokuapp.com/api/?url=http://barletta.house.gov//media-center/press-releases/barletta-takes-lead-on-defunding-obama-executive-amnesty)).

You won't want the code for anything, but it's under the MIT License. See LICENSE.txt for details.
